# Recipe Rating Predictions Based on Nutrition
Authors: Evelyn Zhang & Haowen Zhang

## Overview
In this project, we decided to explore the relationship between different recipe ratings and the relevant nutritional information.

## Introduction

The dataset contains recipes and ratings from [food.com](food.com). You could download the two csv files [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15965zA-g3QbfFqEIzLzk5ICPn4yGzHmr?usp=sharing).

1. `RAW_recipes.csv` contains all recipes
2. `RAW_interactions.csv` contains all reviews and ratings submitted for recipes in `RAW_interactions.csv`

For the first `Recipe` Dataset, there are a total of 83782 rows and 13 columns containing all the recipes' information:
